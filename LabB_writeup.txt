total write number: 48, invalid write number: 2. The percent of invalid write is 4.167 %.
________________________________________________________________________________---

We used most of the carwash example to implement LabB.

For Readrequest and Writerequest and to identify what time the read and write request committed the transaction, we used the timestamp from time method of Python: 

Invalid Write Data:
	To reduce the invalid data below 5 percent, we reduced the number of blocks from varied 300 to 50. We tested with different number of blocks in multiple runs and came to the conclusion 50 is the number of blocks where we receive below 5%.
